# Slova_iz_slov_bot
A popular game "Words in words" (rus. Слова из слов or Наборщик) implemented as a Telegram bot
"Slova is slov" (words made of words), or "Naborschik" (typesetter) is a popular game in the russian-speaking community.
A group of people set a time limit, think of one long word, and begin writing down words that consist of the letters that appear in the original word.
The one who writes down the most different words during the set time, wins! Nevertheless, in some cases more complex rules apply.
Some people nominate the winner as the person who has written down the most "unique" words, as in "those that hadn't been written by any other player".
Sometimes, the length of the written words is considered: the longer - the better (and the more points)!
As you can see, this game is a fun short game for anyone who is interested in practicing Russian words.
